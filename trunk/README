su2espr

1. INTRODUCTION
su2espr is a Sketchup plug-in whose aim is to export geometries
representing zones, created within Sketchup, to the geometry description
file used in ESP-r.

su2espr has been developed by Nestor Perez. Issues with su2espr can be
reported at the project's Google Code site, found at
http://code.google.com/p/su2espr. Questions and suggestions can be
directed to nestor.perezrguez [at] google.com

3. PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS
su2espr has been tested solely under Sketchup version 8. Previous
versions should work as well, although some issues might arise.

4. INSTALLATION
In order to install su2espr, a copy of the file 'su2espr.rb' must be
placed in the Sketchup's plug-in folder which should be located within
Sketchup's installation directory.

5. BASIC USAGE
1) Create a new file within Sketchup and save it in a folder of your
convenience. Note that exported files will be placed in the same folder.

2) Define the geometry of each zone following the same rules required by
ESP-r. (face's normals pointing outwards, etc.)

3) Each surface must be assigned a Sketchup material other than the
default material. Windows or any fenestration containing glazing can be
assigned a translucent material.

4) Once a zone has been defined, select every surface that comprises the
zone and create a GROUP. It is essential that each zone is contained in
a group.

5) Name each zone/group. This will be the exported file name corresponding
to the zone of the same name. A group can be copied to define new zones,
but remember to change the name of the new copy.

6) Place every zone in its specific relative position within the building
to be simulated.

7) Once finished click on the menu entry Plugins->ESP-R.

8) If everything went right you should have as many .geo files as zones
you defined.

Alongside this file there is a folder named 'Example' where a Sketchup
file and the corresponding geometry files, exported taking the former as
a basis, can be found.
